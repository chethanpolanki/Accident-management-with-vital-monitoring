# Accident-management-with-vital-monitoring

This project primarily focuses on reducing the error rate in accident detection, which was the objective of my earlier project. I have incorporated several sensors, such as the MAX30100 to monitor the driver's heart rate, and an MQ3 sensor to detect any signs of alcohol consumption. In addition to accident detection, the system also assesses the driver's condition inside the vehicle. This entire system was developed using an Arduino UNO.

I would like to further advance this project into real-time testing and development with the necessary support.
